1. Based on the fact that "Loading product onto truck." is not printed but
'Product packaged for Next Day.' is printed, I can eliminate the issue to the
loadOnTraffic function. The issue is that there is no parenthesis for the
'loadOnTraffic' function inside of the order function.

2. Inside of the order function, there is no argument passed into the
product.package(). product.package(shippingType) will solve the issue.
